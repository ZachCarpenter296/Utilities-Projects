*/ Philosophical thoughts
10/8/2019

During todayâ€™s discussion, I mostly just thought back to UF 200, where I learned a majority of what I know about philosophy. 
These though experiments start to get more and more weird. 
But, the ideas discovered through them are useful. 
The idea that people kill other people in a game without thinking twice, yet wouldn't ever fight in real life, the violence inconsitencies 
are interesting. But do violent video games make people violent?
